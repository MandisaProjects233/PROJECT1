The BMI Calculator project is a software application designed to help users calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI). This calculator is used for assessing an individual's body weight relative to their height and categorizing them into various weight categories such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obesity. This project aims to provide an easy-to-use, accurate, and informative tool for users to monitor their health and make informed decisions about their fitness and lifestyle.
